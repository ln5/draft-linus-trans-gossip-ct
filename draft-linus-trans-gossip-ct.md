--- abstract

This document describes three gossiping mechanisms for Certificate
Transparency (CT) {{RFC6962}}: SCT Feedback, STH Pollination and
Trusted Auditor Relationship.

SCT Feedback enables HTTPS clients to share Signed Certificate
Timestamps (SCTs) (Section 3.2 of {{RFC6962}}) with CT auditors in a
privacy-preserving manner by sending SCTs to originating HTTPS servers
which in turn share them with CT auditors.

In STH Pollination, HTTPS clients use HTTPS servers as pools sharing
Signed Tree Heads (STHs) (Section 3.5 of {{RFC6962}}) with other
connecting clients in the hope that STHs will find their way to
auditors and monitors.

HTTPS clients in a Trusted Auditor Relationship share SCTs and STHs
with trusted auditors or monitors directly, with expectations of
privacy sensitive data being handled according to whatever privacy
policy is agreed on between client and trusted party.

# Introduction

The purpose of the protocols in this document is to detect misbehavior
by CT logs. In particular, CT logs can misbehave either by rewriting
history or by presenting a "split view" of their operations, also
known as a partitioning attack {{THREAT-ANALYSIS}}. CT provides
mechanisms for detection of these misbehaviors, but only if the
community dependent on the log knows what to do with them. In order
for the community to effectively detect log misbehavior, it needs a
well-defined way to "gossip" about the activity of the logs that makes
use of the available mechanisms.

One of the major challenges of any gossip protocol is limiting damage
to user privacy. The goal of CT gossip is to publish and distribute
information about the logs and their operations, but not to leak any
additional information about the operation of any of the other
particpants. Privacy of consumers of log information (in particular,
of web browsers and other TLS clients) should not be damaged by
gossip.

This document presents three different, complementary mechanisms for
non-log players in the CT ecosystem to exchange information about logs
in a manner that preserves the privacy of the non-log players
involved. They should provide protective benefits for the system as a
whole even if their adoption is not universal.

# Overview

Public append-only untrusted logs have to be monitored for
consistency, i.e., that they should never rewrite history.
Additionally, monitors and other log clients need to exchange
information about monitored logs in order to be able to detect a
partitioning attack.

A partitioning attack is when a log serves different views of the log
to different clients. Each client would be able to verify the
append-only nature of the log while in the extreme case being the only
client seeing this particular view.

Gossiping about what's known about logs helps solve the problem of
detecting malicious or compromised logs mounting such a partitioning
attack. We want some side of the partitioned tree, and ideally both
sides, to see the other side.

Disseminating known information about a log poses a potential threat
to the privacy of end users. Some data of interest (e.g. SCTs) are
linkable to specific log entries and thereby to specific sites, which
makes them privacy-sensitive. Gossip about this data has to take
privacy considerations into account in order not to leak associations
between users of the log (e.g., web browsers) and certificate holders
(e.g., web sites). Even sharing STHs (which do not link to specific
log entries) can be problematic -- user tracking by fingerprinting
through rare STHs is one potential attack.

However, there is no loss in privacy if a client sends SCTs for a
given site to the site corresponding to the SCT, because the site's
access logs would already indicate that the client is accessing that
site. In this way a site can accumulate records of SCTs that have been
issued by various logs for that site, providing a consolidated
repository of SCTs which can be queried by auditors.

Sharing an STH is considered reasonably safe from a privacy
perspective as long as the same STH is shared by a large number of
other clients. This "safety in numbers" is achieved by requiring
gossip only for STHs of a certain "freshness" and limiting the
frequency by which logs can issue STHs.

# Terminology and data flow

This document relies on terminology and data structures defined in
{{RFC6962}}, including STH, SCT, Version, LogID, SCT timestamp,
CtExtensions, SCT signature, Merkle Tree Hash.

The following picture shows how certificates, SCTs and STHs flow
through a CT system with SCT Feedback and STH Pollination. It does not
show what goes in the Trusted Auditor Relationship stream.

# Who gossips {#who}

- HTTPS clients and servers (SCT Feedback and STH Pollination)
- HTTPS servers and CT auditors (SCT Feedback)
- CT auditors and monitors (Trusted Auditor Relationship)

Additionally, some HTTPS clients may engage with an auditor who they
trust with their privacy:

- HTTPS clients and CT auditors (Trusted Auditor Relationship)

# What to gossip about and how {#whathow}

There are three separate gossip streams:

- SCT Feedback, transporting SCTs and certificate chains from HTTPS
  clients to CT auditors/monitors via HTTPS servers.

- STH Pollination, HTTPS clients and CT auditors/monitors using HTTPS
  servers as STH pools for exchanging STHs.

- Trusted Auditor Stream, HTTPS clients communicating directly with
  trusted CT auditors/monitors sharing SCTs, certificate chains and
  STHs.

## SCT Feedback

The goal of SCT Feedback is for clients to share SCTs and certificate
chains with CT auditors and monitors in a privacy-preserving manner.

HTTPS clients store SCTs and certificate chains they see and later
send them to the originating HTTPS server by posting them to a
.well-known URL. This is described in {{feedback-clisrv}}. Note that
clients send the same SCTs and chains to servers multiple times with
the assumption that a potential man-in-the-middle attack eventually
will cease so that an honest server will receive collected malicious
SCTs and certificate chains.

HTTPS servers store SCTs and certificate chains received from clients
and later share them with CT auditors by either posting them or making
them available on a .well-known URL. This is described in
{{feedback-srvaud}}.

### HTTPS client to server {#feedback-clisrv}

An HTTPS client connects to an HTTPS server for a particular
domain. The client receives a set of SCTs as part of the TLS
handshake. The client MUST discard SCTs that are not signed by a known
log and SHOULD store the remaining SCTs together with the
corresponding certificate chain for later use in feedback.

When the client later reconnects to any HTTPS server for the same
domain it again receives a set of SCTs. The client MUST add new SCTs
from known logs to its store of SCTs for the server. The client MUST
send to the server the ones in the store that are for that server and
were not received from that server.

Note that the SCT store also contains SCTs received in certificates.

The client MUST NOT send the same set of SCTs to the same server more
often than TBD.
\[benl: "sent to the server" only really counts if the server presented a valid SCT in the handshake and the certificate is known to be unrevoked (which will be hard for a MitM to sustain)\]
\[TODO: expand on rate/resource limiting motivation\]

An SCT MUST NOT be sent to any other HTTPS server than one serving the
domain that the certificate signed by the SCT refers to. This would
lead to two types of privacy leaks. First, the server receiving the
SCT would learn about other sites visited by the HTTPS
client. Secondly, auditors or monitors receiving SCTs from the HTTPS
server would learn information about the other HTTPS servers visited
by its clients.

If the HTTPS client has configuration options for not sending cookies
to third parties, SCTs MUST be treated as cookies with respect to this
setting.

SCTs and corresponding certificates are POSTed to the originating
HTTPS server at the well-known URL:

    https://<domain>/.well-known/ct/v1/sct-feedback

The data sent in the POST is defined in {{feedback-dataformat}}.

HTTPS servers perform a number of sanity checks on SCTs from clients
before storing them:

  1. if a bit-wise compare of an SCT plus chain matches a pair already
  in the store, this SCT and chain pair MAY be discarded

  1. if the SCT can't be verified to be a valid SCT for the
  accompanying leaf cert, issued by a known log, the SCT SHOULD be
  discarded

  1. if the leaf cert is not for a domain that the server is
  authoritative for, the SCT MUST be discarded

Check number 1 is for detecting duplicates. It's important to note
that the check must be on pairs of SCT and chain in order to catch
different chains accompanied by the same SCT.
\[XXX why is this important?\]

Check number 2 is to prevent spamming attacks where an adversary
can fill up the store prior to attacking a client, or a denial of
service attack on the server's storage space.

Check number 3 is to help malfunctioning clients from leaking which
sites they visit and additionally to prevent spamming attacks.

Note that an HTTPS server MAY perform a certificate chain validation
on a submitted certificate chain, and if it matches a trust root
configured on the server (but is otherwise unknown to the server), the
HTTPS server MAY store the certificate chain and MAY choose to store
any submitted SCTs even if they are unable to be verified. The risk of
spamming and denial of service can be mitigated by configuring the
server with all known acceptable certificates (or certificate hashes).

### HTTPS server to auditors {#feedback-srvaud}

HTTPS servers receiving SCTs from clients SHOULD share SCTs and
certificate chains with CT auditors by either providing the well-known
URL:

    https://<domain>/.well-known/ct/v1/collected-sct-feedback

or by HTTPS POSTing them to a number of preconfigured auditors. This
allows an HTTPS server to choose between an active push model or a
passive pull model.

The data received in a GET of the well-known URL or sent in the POST
is defined in {{feedback-dataformat}}.

HTTPS servers SHOULD share all SCTs and accompanying certificate
chains they see that pass the checks in {{feedback-clisrv}}.

HTTPS servers MUST NOT share any other data that they may learn from
the submission of SCT Feedback by HTTPS clients.

Auditors SHOULD provide the following URL accepting HTTPS POSTing of
SCT feedback data:

    https://<auditor>/ct/v1/sct-feedback

Auditors SHOULD regularly poll HTTPS servers at the well-known
collected-sct-feedback URL. The frequency of the polling and how to
determine which domains to poll is outside the scope of this
document. However, the selection MUST NOT be influenced by potential
HTTPS clients connecting directly to the auditor, as it would reveal
private information provided by the clients.

### SCT Feedback data format {#feedback-dataformat}

The data shared between HTTPS clients and servers as well as between
HTTPS servers and CT auditors/monitors is a JSON object {{RFC7159}}
with the following content:

- sct_feedback: An array of objects consisting of

  - x509_chain: An array of base64-encoded X.509 certificates. The
    first element is the end-entity certificate, the second chains to
    the first and so on.

  - sct_data: An array of objects consisting of the base64
    representation of the binary SCT data as defined in {{RFC6962}}
    Section 3.2.

The 'x509_chain' element MUST contain at the leaf certificate and the
full chain to a known root.

## STH pollination

The goal of sharing Signed Tree Heads (STHs) through pollination is to
share STHs between HTTPS clients, CT auditors, and monitors in a
privacy-preserving manner.

HTTPS servers supporting the protocol act as STH pools. HTTPS clients
and others in the possesion of STHs should pollinate STH pools by
sending STHs to them, and retrieving new STHs to send to new servers.
CT auditors and monitors should retrieve STHs from pools by
downloading STHs from them.

STH Pollination is carried out by sending STHs to HTTPS servers
supporting the protocol, and retrieving new STHs. In the case of HTTPS
clients, STHs are sent in an already established TLS session. This
makes it hard for an attacker to disrupt STH gossiping without also
disturbing ordinary secure browsing (https://).

STHs are sent by POSTing them to the .well-known URL:

    https://<domain>/.well-known/ct/v1/sth-pollination

The data sent in the POST is defined in {{sth-pollination-dataformat}}.

The response contains zero or more STHs in the same format, described
in {{sth-pollination-dataformat}}.

An HTTPS client may acquire STHs by several methods:

- in replies to pollination POSTs;
- asking its supported logs for the current STH directly or indirectly;
- via some other (currently unspecified) mechanism.

HTTPS clients (who have STHs), CT auditors, and monitors SHOULD
pollinate STH pools with STHs. Which STHs to send and how often
pollination should happen is regarded as policy and out of scope for
this document with exception of certain privacy concerns.

An HTTPS client could be tracked by giving it a unique or rare STH.
To address this concern, we place restrictions on different components
of the system to ensure an STH will not be rare.

- Logs cannot issue STHs too frequently. This is restricted to 1 per
  hour.
- HTTPS clients silently ignore STHs which are not fresh.

An STH is considered fresh iff its timestamp is less than 14 days in
the past. Given a maximum STH issuance rate of one per hour, an
attacker has 336 unique STHs per log for tracking.

When multiplied by the number of logs that a client accepts STHs for,
this number of unique STHs grow and the negative privacy implications
grow with it. It's important that this is taken into account when logs
are chosen for default settings in HTTPS clients.

\[TBD urge HTTPS clients to store STHs retrieved in responses?\]

\[TBD share inclusion proofs and consistency proofs too?\]

### HTTPS client STH and Inclusion Proof Fetching

An HTTPS client retrieves SCTs from an HTTPS server, and must obtain
an inclusion proof to an STH in order to verify the promise made by
the SCT. This retrieval mechanism reveals the client's browsing habits
when the client requests the proof diretly from the log. To mitigate
this risk, an HTTPS client MUST retrieve the proof in a manner that
disguises the client from the log.

Additionally, for this inclusion proof to be acceptable to the client,
the inclusion proof MUST reference a STH that is within the acceptable
freshness interval.

Depending on the client's DNS provider, DNS may provide an appropriate
intermediate layer that obfuscates the linkability between the user of
the client and the request for inclusion (while at the same time
providing a caching layer for oft-requested inclusion proofs.)

Also Tor.

### Auditor and Monitor Action

Auditors and Monitors participate in STH pollination by retrieving
STHs from HTTPS servers. They verify that the STH is valid by checking
the signature, and requesting a consistency proof from the STH to the
most recent STH.

After retrieving the consistency proof to the most recent STH, they
SHOULD pollinate this new STH among participating HTTPS Servers. In
this way, as STHs "age out" and are no longer fresh, their "lineage"
continues to be tracked in the system.

### STH Pollination data format {#sth-pollination-dataformat}

The data sent from HTTPS clients and CT monitors and auditors to HTTPS
servers is a JSON object {{RFC7159}} with the following content:

- sths -- an array of 0 or more fresh STH objects
  \[XXX recently collected\] from the log associated with log_id. Each
  of these objects consists of

  - sth_version: Version as defined in {{RFC6962}} Section 3.2, as a
    number. The version of the protocol to which the sth_gossip object
    conforms.

  - tree_size: The size of the tree, in entries, as a number.

  - timestamp: The timestamp of the STH as defined in {{RFC6962}}
    Section 3.2, as a number.

  - sha256_root_hash: The Merkle Tree Hash of the tree as defined in
    {{RFC6962}} Section 2.1, as a base64 encoded string.

  - tree_head_signature: A TreeHeadSignature as defined in
    {{RFC6962}} Section 3.5 for the above data, as a base64 encoded
    string.

  - log_id: LogID as defined in {{RFC6962}} Section 3.2, as a base64
    encoded string.

\[XXX An STH is considered recently collected iff TBD.\]

## Trusted Auditor Stream

HTTPS clients MAY send SCTs and cert chains, as well as STHs, directly
to auditors. Note that there are privacy implications in doing so,
these are outlined in {{privacy-SCT}} and {{privacy-trusted-auditors}}.

The most natural trusted auditor arrangement arguably is a web browser
that is "logged in to" a provider of various internet
services. Another equivalent arrangement is a trusted party like a
corporation to which an employer [XXX employee?] is connected through a VPN or by
other similar means. A third might be individuals or smaller groups of
people running their own services. In such a setting, retrieving STHs
and inclusion proofs from that third party in order to validate SCTs
could be considered reasonable from a privacy perspective. The HTTPS
client does its own auditing and might additionally share SCTs and
STHs with the trusted party to contribute to herd immunity. Here, the
ordinary {{RFC6962}} protocol is sufficient for the client to do the
auditing while SCT Feedback and STH Pollination can be used in whole
or in parts for the gossip part.

Another well established trusted party arrangement on the internet
today is the relation between internet users and their providers of
DNS resolver services. DNS resolvers are typically provided by the
internet service provider (ISP) used, which by the nature of name
resolving already know a great deal about which sites their users
visit. As mentioned in Section XXX, in order for HTTPS clients to be
able to retrieve inclusion proofs for certificates in a privacy
preserving manner, logs could expose a DNS interface in addition to
the ordinary HTTPS interface. An informal writeup of such a protocol
can be found at XXX.


### Trusted Auditor data format

\[TBD specify something here or leave this for others?\]

# Security considerations

## Privacy considerations

The most sensitive relationships in the CT ecosystem are the
relationships between HTTPS clients and HTTPS servers. Client-server
relationships can be aggregated into a network graph with potentially
serious implications for correlative de-anonymisation of clients and
relationship-mapping or clustering of servers or of clients.

### Privacy and SCTs {#privacy-SCT}

An SCT contains information that links it to a particular web
site. Because the client-server relationship is sensitive, gossip
between clients and servers about unrelated SCTs is risky. Therefore,
a client with an SCT for a given server should transmit that
information in only two channels: to a server associated with the SCT
itself; and to a trusted CT auditor, if one exists.

### Privacy in SCT Feedback {#privacy-feedback}

SCTs introduce yet another mechanism for HTTPS servers to store state
on an HTTPS client, and potentially track users. HTTPS clients which
allow users to clear history or cookies associated with an origin MUST
clear stored SCTs associated with the origin as well.

Auditors should treat all SCTs as sensitive data. SCTs received
directly from an HTTPS client are especially sensitive, because the
auditor is a trusted by the client to not reveal their associations
with servers. Auditors MUST NOT share such SCTs in any way, including
sending them to an external log, without first mixing them with
multiple other SCTs learned through submissions from multiple other
clients. The details of mixing SCTs are TBD.

There is a possible fingerprinting attack where a log issues a unique
SCT for targeted log client(s). A colluding log and HTTPS server
operator could therefore be a threat to the privacy of an HTTPS
client. Given all the other opportunities for HTTPS servers to
fingerprint clients -- TLS session tickets, HPKP and HSTS headers,
HTTP Cookies, etc. -- this is acceptable.

The fingerprinting attack described above could be avoided by
requiring that logs i) MUST return the same SCT for a given cert chain
({{RFC6962}} Section 3) and ii) use a deterministic signature scheme
when signing the SCT ({{RFC6962}} Section 2.1.4).

There is another similar fingerprinting attack where an HTTPS server
tracks a client by using a variation of cert chains. The risk for this
attack is accepted on the same grounds as the unique SCT attack
described above. \[XXX any mitigations possible here?\]

### Privacy for HTTPS clients requesting STHs

An HTTPS client that does not act as an auditor should only request an
STH from a CT log that it accepts SCTs from. An HTTPS client should
regularly [XXX how regularly? This has operational implications for log
operators] request an STH from all logs it is willing to accept, even
if it has seen no SCTs from that log.

### Privacy in STH Pollination

An STH linked to an HTTPS client may indicate the following about that
client:

- that the client gossips;

- that the client been using CT at least until the time that the
  timestamp and the tree size indicate;

- that the client is talking, possibly indirectly, to the log
  indicated by the tree hash;

- which software and software version is being used.

There is a possible fingerprinting attack where a log issues a unique
STH for a targeted log auditor or HTTPS client. This is similar to the
fingerprinting attack described in {{privacy-feedback}}, but it is
mitigated by the following factors:

- the relationship between auditors and logs is not sensitive in the
  way that the relationship between HTTPS clients and HTTPS servers
  is;

- because auditors regularly exchange STHs with each other, the
  re-appearance of a targeted STH from some auditor does not imply
  that the auditor was the original one targeted by the log;

- an HTTPS client's relationship to a log is not sensitive in the way
  that its relationship to an HTTPS server is. As long as the client
  does not query the log for anything other than individual STHs, the
  client should not leak anything else to the log itself. However, a
  log and an HTTPS server which are collaborating could use this 
  technique to fingerprint a targeted HTTPS client.

Note that an HTTPS client in the configuration described in this
document doesn't make direct use of the STH itself. Its fetching of
the STH and reporting via STH Pollination provides a benefit to the CT
ecosystem as a whole by providing oversight on logs, but the HTTPS
client itself will not necessarily derive direct benefit.

### Trusted Auditors for HTTPS Clients {#privacy-trusted-auditors}

Some HTTPS clients may choose to use a trusted auditor. This trust
relationship leaks a certain amount of information from the client to
the auditor. In particular, it is likely to identify the web sites
that the client has visited to the auditor. Some clients may already
share this information to a third party, for example, when using a
server to synchronize browser history across devices in a
server-visible way, or when doing DNS lookups through a trusted DNS
resolver. For clients with such a relationship already established,
sending SCT Feedback to the same organization does not appear to leak
any additional information to the trusted third party.

Clients who wish to contact an auditor without associating their
identities with their SCT Feedback may wish to use an anonymizing
network like Tor to submit SCT Feedback to the auditor. Auditors
SHOULD accept SCT Feedback that arrives over such anonymizing
networks.

Clients sending feedback to an auditor may prefer to reduce the
temporal granularity of the history leakage to the auditor by caching
and delaying their SCT Feedback reports. This strategy is only as
effective as the granularity of the timestamps embedded in the SCTs
and STHs.

### HTTPS Clients as Auditors

Some HTTPS Clients may choose to act as Auditors themselves. A Client
taking on this role needs to consider the following:

- an Auditing HTTPS Client potentially leaks their history to the logs
  that they query. Querying the log through a cache or a proxy with
  many other users may avoid this leakage, but may leak information to
  the cache or proxy, in the same way that an non-Auditing HTTPS
  Client leaks information to a trusted Auditor.

- an effective Auditor needs a strategy about what to do in the event
  that it discovers misbehavior from a log. Misbehavior from a log
  involves the log being unable to provide either (a) a consistency
  proof between two valid STHs or (b) an inclusion proof for a
  certificate to an STH any time after the log's MMD has elapsed from
  the issuance of the SCT. The log's inability to provide either proof
  will not be externally cryptographically-verifiable, as it may be
  indistinguishable from a network error.
